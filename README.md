# Portfolio AI – Strategic Innovation Planning Tool

**Portfolio AI** is a Streamlit-based prototype that evaluates business units on **Maturity**, **Disruption Risk**, and **Innovation Capability**, then classifies them and recommends an innovation investment mix (Core / Adjacent / Transformational) with tailored idea suggestions. Originally built as a proof-of-concept for TC Energy, the framework is adaptable to any enterprise seeking a transparent, explainable approach to innovation portfolio planning.

## Features
* Explainable scoring on three dimensions with clear 1–5 scales and rule-based logic
* Auto-classification into Core / Emerging / At Risk / Laggard with recommended investment mixes (e.g., 70/20/10 for Core).
* Interactive UI in Streamlit with scorecards, pie charts, and a decision-tree visualization for transparency.
* Tailored innovation ideas tagged as Core, Adjacent, or Transformational.
